- __What is the Internet? *(Ip Address, localhost)*__
- __TCP/UDP__

### 1.What is OSI Model.[^1]
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.[^2]
### How is the OSI Model organized?
It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

The lowest level: __*layer 1*__ which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal.

The highest level: __*layer 7*__ which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc

[^2]:Keep in mind that the OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.
[^1]:The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology

### 2.What is LAN & WAN?
__A local area network (LAN)__ is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.

__A wide area network (WAN)__[^3] is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area.

[^3]:A WAN is a geographically-dispersed collection of LANs. WANs tend to use technology like ATM, Frame Relay, and X.25 for connectivity over the longer distances.
